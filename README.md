# outSystems-LOWCODE
making code with no code what?


spent the day installing Outsystems a 'low-code' web tablet and mobile page / app development tool that uses drag and drop development to make a 'react app' using html css and javascript without any code being typed by the creator.

pretty cool

the 5 minute first app tutorial took me over 5 hours.

The first 30 minutes was trying to get it running on my 2018 Mac book Air.

Bad News - it won't run if you have upgraded to the Catilina OS. This prob has been know since october of last year. Support fixing? unknown.

The next 3 hours was trying to install it on my old HP laptop. Bought in 2010. Which hadn't been used since 2018. After downloading it, and vs code, python, and getting about halfway throught the tutorial it froze up when it couldn't find chrome browser. I had only been using firefox. 

Finally got it running on my Dell - something about goldiloks there...

I'm not telling you my password.

I'll make something tomorrow without a login.
